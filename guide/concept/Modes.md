# Stealth /Site Modes

The `Site Modes` decide what type of content to load from a specific URL
and what to optimize in the loaded HTML content in regards to what is being
displayed and what not.


## Media Types

- `text` loads text files.
- `image` loads image files.
- `audio` loads audio files.
- `video` loads video files.
- `other` downloads files that cannot be rendered.
