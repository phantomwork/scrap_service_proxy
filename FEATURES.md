## CSS Features

Currently, the [CSS Parser](./stealth/source/parser/CSS.mjs) tries to achieve maximum
compatibility with the CSS 3 specification, as long as features don't compromise
privacy or security of the client system.

Additionally, these CSS features are not implemented:

- [ ] `@counter-style` is unsupported.
- [ ] `grid`, `grid-area`, `grid-column`, `grid-row`, `grid-template` are unsupported.
- [ ] `offset` is unsupported.
