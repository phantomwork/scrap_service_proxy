# Notes

These are important notes that need to be revised at a later point in time, but they are technically no issues,
that's why they are collected in here:

- [ ] Clarify whether Win10 crypt32.dll supports `TLS_Method` or really only `SSLv3`.
- [ ] HTTP connection needs support for `Content-Disposition` header to be able to download generated files (e.g. `download.php?id=1337`).
- [ ] HTTP connection needs support for `Content-Location` header to be able to map redirects correctly (e.g. `redirect.php?id=1337`).
- [ ] `Image Optimizers` to compress images on-disk-cache (`optipng`, `libjpeg-turbo`, `convert` from `bmp` to `jpeg`).
- [ ] `Video Optimizers` to compress videos on-disk-cache (convert to `mp4` or `mkv`).
